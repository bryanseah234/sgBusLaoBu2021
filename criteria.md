# [NYJC] JC2 Capstone project: Bus search

The purpose of this project is to develop an application that allows users to search for bus data.

In this project, you will demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have picked up so far in your H2 Computing lessons.

Your project must:
1. Use a database to store data
2. Use Flask to serve a web app that allows user interaction
3. Provide a feature that involves both database lookup **and** data processing; it cannot only be a browsing/lookup application
   - e.g. Searching for nearest bus stop to a point
   - e.g. Searching for common bus stops between two routes
   - e.g. Determining travel time between two points on a bus route
   - e.g. Calculating travel fare between two points on a bus route
   - e.g. For two given bus stops, search for all routes that pass through both bus stops

The data for bus routes, bus services, and bus stops comes from the [LTA Data Mall API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html). You can refer to the [API User Guide](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/LTA_DataMall_API_User_Guide.pdf) (Sections 2.2 to 2.4) for more details and documentation on the data format.
